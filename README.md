# Rust CDEvents SDK

Rust SDK to emit [CDEvents](https://cdevents.dev).

The SDK can be used to create CDEvents and send them as CloudEvents, as well as parse a received CloudEvent into a CDEvent.

## Get started

```rust
WIP
```

## Create your first CDEvent

To create a CDEvent, for instance a [*pipelineRun queued*](https://cdevents.dev/docs/core/#pipelinerun-queued) one:

```rust
WIP
```

## Send your first CDEvent as CloudEvent

Import the modules in your code

```rust

```

To send a CDEvent as CloudEvent:

```rust

```

See the [CloudEvents](https://github.com/cloudevents/sdk-go#send-your-first-cloudevent) docs as well.
